Tranquilify
===========

The goal is to create a set of headphones that selectively suppresses specific sounds in the environment. This is designed for people who are sensitive to certain sounds, such as people with misophonia or autism. The headphones will learn over time which sounds to suppress and which to allow, and will be able to adapt to new sounds as they are encountered.
